In the above paper, we represent hypergraphs as partially ordered sets or posets, and provide a geometric framework based on posets to compute the Forman–Ricci curvature of vertices as well as hyperedges in hypergraphs. Thereafter, we perform an empirical study involving computation and analysis of the Forman–Ricci curvature of hyperedges in 12 real-world hypergraphs.
